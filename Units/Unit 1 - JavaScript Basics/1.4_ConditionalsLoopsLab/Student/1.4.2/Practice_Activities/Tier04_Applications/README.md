# Tier04 Applications — Real‑World Mini‑Apps

🎯 **Learning Goals**
- Understand the concept and syntax shown in the examples.
- Follow step-by-step tasks to build working code.
- Test with sample inputs and read Console messages.

## 🌟 Mini‑Lesson: What & Why

- Now apply what you know to small, realistic tasks.
- Think about **state** (like `balance` in an ATM) and **input validation** (checking numbers/strings).
- Break problems into steps: inputs → decisions → loops → outputs.

## 🧩 Try It: Step‑by‑Step Tasks

### 16) Login System
Ask for username+password. If both match stored values → 'Welcome!' else 'Invalid credentials.'

### 17) Weather Bot
Ask for weather (`sunny/rainy/cold`), normalize with `.toLowerCase()`, and suggest an outfit.

### 18) ATM Simulator
`balance=100`. Menu loop (deposit/withdraw/balance/exit). Guard against overdraft.

### 19) Dice Roller (doubles)
Roll 2 dice 10 times; print when doubles appear.

### 20) Mini Quiz App
Arrays of questions/answers; loop, grade, and print percentage.

## 💡 Challenge
- Try modifying one task to add a small twist of your own.

## ✅ Exit Ticket
- In one sentence: What is one mistake you made today and how did you fix it?
