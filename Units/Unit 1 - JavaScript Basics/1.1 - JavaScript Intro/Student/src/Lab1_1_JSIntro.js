   1. What new concept or skill did you learn in this lab?
         A new concept I learned in the lab is that Javascript is stricter than html and css, for ex. capital letters.

   2. How did you apply logic or conditionals in your code?
         I applied logic into my code through my past lessons I've learned and following directions.

   3. What challenges did you encounter, and how did you solve them?
         I encountered some misstyped codes leading them to errors, I went into 'Inspect', 'Console' to locate and fix the error.

   4. Where else could this programming concept be useful?
         Right now Im so early into the lesson I dont have an idea where I can use this yet.
