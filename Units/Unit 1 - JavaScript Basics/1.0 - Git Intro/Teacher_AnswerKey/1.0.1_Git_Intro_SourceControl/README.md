# 1.0.1 – Git Intro (Source Control) — Teacher Notes

## Expected Outcomes
- Repo initialized; 3–5 commits with messages similar to:
  - `feat: personalize heading`
  - `style: improve text legibility`
  - `docs: add minimal readme`
- Branch created: `feature/readme` → merged into `main`.
- Remote published (GitHub). One additional sync after a commit.

## Quick Rubric (10 pts)
- (2) Initialized repo, .git present
- (3) Three meaningful commits
- (2) Branch + merge completed
- (2) Remote published + 1 push/pull
- (1) Exit ticket response completeness

## Common Pitfalls & Fixes
- **Auth issues in VS Code:** Run `Git: Sign In` from Command Palette or use token auth.
- **Accidental commit to wrong branch:** Switch to correct branch → `git cherry-pick <sha>` (advanced) or permit for beginner: make a new commit on correct branch and proceed.
- **‘Publish Branch’ missing:** Ensure a workspace folder is open and Git is enabled.
